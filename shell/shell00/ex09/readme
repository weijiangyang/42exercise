A magic file rule is for the purpose of identifying files based on specific characteristics.
1. Create the ft_magic File
Use a text editor to create a file named ft_magic and add the following content:

go
Copy code
41    string    42    42 file type

Explanation of the Content
42: Specifies the offset (starting at byte 42) where the magic test begins.
string: Indicates that the type of data being matched is a string.
42: The exact string to match at the specified offset.
42 file type: The description that will be output if the condition is met.

2. Test the Magic File
2.1 Create a Test File
Use a tool like dd or any text editor to create a test file with the string 42 at the 42nd byte:

bash
Copy code
printf '%040s42' > test_file
This command creates a file where the first 41 bytes are spaces, followed by 42.

2.2 Test the File with file
Run the file command with the -m option to specify the custom magic file:

bash
Copy code
file -m ft_magic test_file
