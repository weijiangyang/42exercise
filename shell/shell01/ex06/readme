To display every other line of the output from the ls -l command, starting from the first line, you can use the sed command as follows:

bash
Copy code
ls -l | sed -n '1~2p'
Explanation:

ls -l: Lists files in long format.
sed -n '0~2p':
0~2: This is a sed command to print every 2nd line, starting from line 0.
p: This prints the matched lines.
