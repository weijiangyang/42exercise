Explanation:

cat /etc/passwd: Displays the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
sed '/^#/d': Removes lines starting with a #, which are comments.
awk 'NR % 2 == 1': Outputs every other line, starting from the second.
rev: Reverses each login name.
sort -r: Sorts the reversed logins in reverse alphabetical order.
awk "NR >= FT_LINE1 && NR <= FT_LINE2": Selects lines between FT_LINE1 and FT_LINE2.
tr '\n' ', ': Converts newlines to commas, separating each login with a comma.
sed 's/, $/./': Removes the trailing comma and adds a period at the end.


The command sed 's/, $/./' is a stream editor operation that replaces text in a stream or file. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Command Breakdown:
sed: The stream editor.
s: Indicates a substitution command.
/, $/:
/ are the delimiters for the pattern.
, $ is the pattern to match:
,: Matches a literal comma.
$: Anchors the match to the end of a line (matches if the comma is followed by a space and occurs at the line's end).
/./:
.: Replacement text; replaces the matched pattern with a period.
Final Result: Replaces a comma followed by a space at the end of a line with a period.
Use Case:
If you have a list of items separated by commas, with a trailing , at the end, this command cleans up the format.

Example:
Input:
Copy code
apple, banana, cherry, 
Command:
bash
Copy code
echo "apple, banana, cherry, " | sed 's/, $/./'
Output:
Copy code
apple, banana, cherry.
This is useful for formatting outputs, such as when creating human-readable lists in scripts.
