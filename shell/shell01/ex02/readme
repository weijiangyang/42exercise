To find all file names that end with .sh in the current directory and its sub-directories and display their names without the .sh extension, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
find . -type f -name "*.sh" -exec basename {} .sh \;
Explanation:
find .:

Searches in the current directory (.) and all its subdirectories.
-type f:

Limits the search to files only.
-name "*.sh":

Filters for file names ending with .sh.
-exec basename {} .sh \;:

For each matching file, the basename command is used to remove the .sh extension and display only the file name.
